# tictactoe2
Although the previous tictactoe project worked as intented, the use of function modules were limited, ignoring the main learning purpose of the tutorial. In this one, I have split the gameStart module into 4 parts.

### What I have learned
- Using function modules and factories
- Manipulating function scopes using return
- namespacing
